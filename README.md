# TicTacToe_001X_V1
This is a basic Tic Tac Toe game I made using pygame library in Python. This is a project for my CSE200 Lab Course.

Here I primarily use the pygame library and various functions associated with it to develop a (seemingly) complete Tic Tac Toe game. 
I know it isn't perfect, but this is my first ever complete coding project. So what can I expect? 
This one actually turned out to be much better than I expected.
